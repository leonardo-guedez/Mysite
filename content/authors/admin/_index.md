I am a Ph.D. student in Second Language Studies at Michigan State University. My research interests include quantitative corpus linguistics with R, learner corpus research, and second language psycholinguistics. I am also an active member of the [Second Language Studies Corpus Lab](https://corpus.cal.msu.edu/), which is co-directed by Dr. Sandra Deshors and Dr. Charlene Polio.
